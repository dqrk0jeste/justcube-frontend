# ARCHIVED

this is a half baked idea if a platform for cubers where one could share their solves, records, opinions etc. and also make rooms to hangout or tournaments to compete with each other.

unfortunatly, it was just too much for a single developer (me). i might revisit the idea in the future, and implement something a bit more feasable.
